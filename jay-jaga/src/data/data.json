The chariot's superstructure (above the wheels) contains eighteen pillars and roofs at various stages, known as bhuin, potala, parabhadi, etc. The chariot making process is complicated and there are 34 components of each chariot. Each chariot contains nine subsidiary deities (Parswa Devatas), four horses (Ghoda), two door keepers (Dwarapalas), one charioteer (Sarathi), one deity for the top flag (Dhwaja Devata), and eight female companions (Ashta Manjari), all made of wood."
